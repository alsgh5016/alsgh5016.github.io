# About
I'm a **Ph.D. student** in the School of Software at **Soongsil University**, Seoul, Korea, and a researcher at **the Cyber Security Research Center (CSEC)**. My primary research interests are in **systems security**, focusing on identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities. I am also passionate about analyzing, discovering, and solving security issues across various domains.
